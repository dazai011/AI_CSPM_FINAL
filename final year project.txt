final year project 

Below are all the commands your CSPM Shell supports, with explanation.

✅ 1. Run a Cloud Scan

This is your first major command.

scan


This will run:

EC2 scan

S3 scan

Security Groups scan

Any other AWS resource scan your scanner handles

Output will appear in the terminal.

✅ 2. Run AI-Based AWS Security Analysis

If you want the AI-generated security report (LLM-powered):

analyze


Add --save if you want it saved to a file:

analyze --save


This uses:

analyze_aws

Your local Mistral GGUF model

Generates a structured security report

✅ 3. Ask the LLM Questions

To talk to your local AI model:

ai <question>


Example:

ai summarize my aws risks


or

ai what are common misconfigurations

✅ 4. AI Analyze (Generic Multi-Provider)

More detailed AI review of your AWS resources:

ai_analyze


or

ai_analyze aws


This gathers:

S3 bucket count

Bucket names

Security groups

SGs open to 0.0.0.0/0

And other lightweight findings

Then your Mistral model generates a structured JSON report.

🚀 Recommended Workflow (Step-by-Step)
🔹 Step 1: Connect (already done)
connect

🔹 Step 2: Scan AWS
scan

🔹 Step 3: Run AI analysis
analyze


or:

analyze --save

🔹 Step 4: Ask AI any question (optional)
ai how many buckets do I have

🔹 Step 5: More detailed AI report
ai_analyze

🎯 If you want the tool to automatically check for:

✔ Public S3 buckets
✔ Open ports in SGs
✔ IAM privilege escalation
✔ RDS exposure
✔ EKS issues
✔ CloudTrail misconfigurations
